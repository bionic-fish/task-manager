# task-manager

A basic task managing application [to do app] written in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

Development:<br>

Create a to-do list application that is able to get user data via an input field and display it in a list.<br>
Sort the list into 2 categories on the click of a button<br>
Category 1: complete = click the complete button to move the list item to "completed list area".<br>
Category 2: leave the list items in the parent container until and event is triggered to either move or delete.<br>

Attach event handlers to create list items, add a complete and delete button in the list interface and attach the input data to the list

JavaScript Features Learned:<br>

Event handling: used to ensure a specific function, action or event happens when a user interacts. I attached an event listener to the top header button with an event listener. This included an onclick event, and a function that reads the data input, if there is any, and proceeds to create a list with the aforemention extracted data string input.
